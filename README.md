# CHALLENGE Game - Refugee Education Policy Simulation

CHALLENGE (Creating Holistic Approaches for Learning, Liberty, and Equity in New Global Education) is an interactive simulation game focused on refugee education policymaking. This web application allows users to engage with the complexities of education policy for refugee populations under budget constraints, promoting critical reflection on justice and inclusion.

## Overview

The game is played in three phases with one real participant and four AI-generated agents:

1. **Phase I: Scenario Reading & Individual Decision-Making**
   - Players read about the fictional Republic of Bean
   - Each player selects policy options across seven categories without exceeding 14 budget units

2. **Phase II: Group Discussion & Consensus-Building**
   - The real participant debates with four AI agents representing different ideological stances
   - Decisions are made through majority voting
   - The final policy package must stay within the 14-unit budget

3. **Phase III: Reflection & Debrief**
   - The participant answers guided reflection questions
   - The system generates an evaluation report based on choices and reflections

## Installation

To run the CHALLENGE Game locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the project folder
cd challenge-game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Game Features

- **Realistic Policy Simulation**: 7 policy categories with 3 options each
- **Dynamic Budget System**: Real-time tracking of budget allocation
- **AI Agents**: Four agents with distinct political and ideological stances
- **Interactive Dialogue**: Voice and text-based interaction with AI agents
- **Voting System**: Majority-based group decision mechanism
- **Reflection Module**: Guided questions to promote critical thinking
- **Evaluation Report**: Final analysis of policy choices and justice considerations

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Material UI for the user interface
- Context API for state management

## Educational Context

This simulation is designed for educational purposes, particularly in:
- Teacher education programs
- Policy studies courses
- Refugee and migration studies
- Educational leadership training

The goal is to promote justice-oriented thinking about refugee education and to create awareness about the complex interplay of politics, resources, and ethics in educational policymaking.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with speech-to-text API for more natural voice interaction
- More sophisticated AI agent responses based on OpenAI or similar technologies
- Enhanced visualization of policy impacts
- Mobile-responsive design

## Credits

Developed as part of the AI CHALLENGE Hackathon, inspired by research on refugee education policy and critical pedagogy.
